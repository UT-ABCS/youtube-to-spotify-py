This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://shaded-nigella-ee4.notion.site/Technical-Workshops-f5b3950311e34a1c85e84a4b89cb7702).  <br />

This workshop will cover the use of Google Cloud Services and a Web API within a Python application. The goal of this project is to utilize the YouTube Data API and the Spotify Web API to take songs from within a public YouTube playlist and automate the creation of a Spotify playlist. You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://google.com). This project was inspired by Bukola's [Automate Spotify with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J_qcttfnJA) video.  <br />
